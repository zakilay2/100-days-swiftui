## How to store truth with Booleans

Booleans, named after mathematician George Boole, are a data type in programming that store either ```true``` or ```false```. Although weâ€™ve seen strings, integers, and decimals, Booleans have also been used in examples, like ```hasSuffix(".jpg")``` and ```isMultiple(of: 3)```, which return ```true or false``` values based on their checks.

Booleans are created by assigning ```true``` or ```false``` values directly or from expressions that evaluate to either value. Unlike other types, Booleans lack arithmetic operators but have a ! operator that flips their value (e.g., ```false``` to ```true```). Another useful feature is the ```toggle()``` method, which switches a Boolean's value. For example:

```swift
var gameOver = false
print(gameOver)  // false

gameOver.toggle()
print(gameOver)  // true
```

This method simplifies code when working with Boolean conditions.

## How to join strings together
Swift provides two main ways to combine strings: the + operator and string interpolation.

1. **Using +:** You can join two strings with +, as in:
let greeting = "Hello, " + "world!"
However, this approach can be inefficient if you combine multiple strings, as Swift creates temporary strings for each step.

2. **String Interpolation:** This method is more efficient and versatile, allowing you to insert variables of any type directly into a string with \(), like this:

```swift
let name = "Taylor"
let age = 26
let message = "Hello, my name is \(name) and I'm \(age) years old."
```

String interpolation not only simplifies code but also handles non-string types (integers, decimals) without extra conversion. It even allows calculations within the interpolation, such as:

```swift
print("5 x 5 is \(5 * 5)")
```

String interpolation is preferred over + for combining strings due to its efficiency and readability.
